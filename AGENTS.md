## Project Overview

Agent Zero is a dynamic, organic agentic framework designed to grow and learn. It uses the operating system as a tool, featuring a multi-agent cooperation model where every agent can create subordinates to break down tasks.

Type: Full-Stack Agentic Framework (Python Backend + Alpine.js Frontend)
Status: Active Development
Primary Language(s): Python, JavaScript (ES Modules)

---

## Core Commands

### Setup
Do not combine these commands; run them individually:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements2.txt
```
- Start WebUI: python run_ui.py

---

## Docker Environment

When running in Docker, Agent Zero uses two distinct Python runtimes to isolate the framework from the code being executed:

### 1. Framework Runtime (/opt/venv-a0)
- Version: Python 3.12.4
- Purpose: Runs the Agent Zero backend, API, and core logic.
- Packages: Contains all dependencies from requirements.txt.

### 2. Execution Runtime (/opt/venv)
- Version: Python 3.13
- Purpose: Default environment for the interactive terminal and the agent's code execution tool.
- Behavior: This is the environment active when you docker exec into the container. Packages installed by the agent via pip install during a task are stored here.

---

## Development Patterns & Conventions

### Backend (Python)
- Context Access: Use from agent import AgentContext, AgentContextType (not helpers.context).
- Communication: Use mq from helpers.messages to log proactive UI messages:
  mq.log_user_message(context.id, "Message", source="Plugin")
- API Handlers: Derive from ApiHandler in helpers/api.py.
- Extensions: Use the extension framework in helpers/extension.py for lifecycle hooks.
- Error Handling: Use RepairableException for errors the LLM might be able to fix.

### Frontend (Alpine.js)
- Store Gating: Always wrap store-dependent content in a template:
```html
<div x-data>
  <template x-if="$store.myStore">
    <div x-init="$store.myStore.onOpen()">...</div>
  </template>
</div>
```
- Store Registration: Use createStore from /js/AlpineStore.js.
- Modals: Use openModal(path) and closeModal() from /js/modals.js.

### Plugin Architecture
- Location: Always develop new plugins in usr/plugins/.
- Manifest: Every plugin requires a plugin.yaml with name, description, version, and optionally settings_sections, per_project_config, per_agent_config, and always_enabled.
- Discovery: Conventions based on folder names (api/, tools/, webui/, extensions/).
- Plugin-local Python imports: Prefer `usr.plugins.<plugin_name>...` for code that lives under `usr/plugins/`. Avoid `sys.path` hacks and avoid symlink-dependent `plugins.<plugin_name>...` imports for community plugins.
- Runtime hooks: Plugins may also expose hooks in hooks.py, callable by the framework through helpers.plugins.call_plugin_hook(...).
- Hook runtime: hooks.py executes inside the Agent Zero framework Python environment, so sys.executable -m pip installs dependencies into that same framework runtime.
- Environment targeting: If a plugin needs packages or binaries for the separate agent execution runtime or system environment, it must explicitly switch environments in a subprocess by targeting the correct interpreter, virtualenv, or package manager.
- Settings: Use get_plugin_config(plugin_name, agent=agent) to retrieve settings. Plugins can expose a UI for settings via webui/config.html. Plugin settings modals instantiate a local context from $store.pluginSettingsPrototype; bind plugin fields to config.* and use context.* for modal-level state and actions.
- Activation: Global and scoped activation rules are stored as .toggle-1 (ON) and .toggle-0 (OFF). Scoped rules are handled via the plugin "Switch" modal.
- Cleanup rule: Plugins should not permanently modify the system in ways that outlive the plugin. Deleting a plugin should not leave behind symlinks, unmanaged services, or stray files outside plugin-owned paths unless the user explicitly requested that behavior.

### Releases
- Docker publishing automation lives in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.
- Releasable tags follow `v{X}.{Y}` and only tags `>= v1.0` are considered by the workflow.
- The latest eligible tag on `main` also creates or updates a GitHub release after the Docker image push succeeds.
- GitHub release notes are generated on the fly in `.github/scripts/docker_release_plan.py` by comparing the new tag against the previous published GitHub release tag, collecting commit subjects and descriptions in that range, and sending them to OpenRouter.
- The OpenRouter call uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MODEL_NAME` from the workflow environment, with the system prompt stored in `scripts/openrouter_release_notes_system_prompt.md`.
- Prioritize user-visible features, important fixes, infra or packaging changes, and breaking notes. Skip low-signal churn.
- If the generated summary has no meaningful content, the release body falls back to `No release notes.`

### Lifecycle Synchronization
| Action | Backend Extension | Frontend Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| Initialization | agent_init | init() in Store |
| Mounting | N/A | x-create directive |
| Processing | monologue_start/end | UI loading state |
| Cleanup | context_deleted | x-destroy directive |

## Safety and Permissions

### Allowed Without Asking
- Read any file in the repository.
- Update code files in usr/.

### Ask Before Executing
- pip install (new dependencies).
- Deleting core files outside of usr/ or tmp/.
- Modifying agent.py or initialize.py.
- Making git commits or pushes.

### Never Do
- Commit, hardcode or leak secrets or .env files.
- Bypass CSRF or authentication checks.
- Hardcode API keys.

---

## Code Examples

### API Handler (Good)
```python
from helpers.api import ApiHandler, Request, Response

class MyHandler(ApiHandler):
    async def process(self, input: dict, request: Request) -> dict | Response:
        # Business logic here
        return {"ok": True, "data": "result"}
```

### Alpine Store (Good)
```javascript
import { createStore } from "/js/AlpineStore.js";

export const store = createStore("myStore", {
    items: [],
    init() { /* global setup */ },
    onOpen() { /* mount setup */ },
    cleanup() { /* unmount cleanup */ }
});
```

### Tool Definition (Good)
```python
from helpers.tool import Tool, Response

class MyTool(Tool):
    async def execute(self, **kwargs):
        # Tool logic
        return Response(message="Success", break_loop=False)
```

---

## Git Workflow

- Docker publish automation lives in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.
- Release tags handled by automation must match `vX.Y` and be `>= v1.0`.
- Allowed release branches are configured at the top of the workflow. `main` publishes `<tag>` and `latest`; other allowed branches publish only the branch tag.
- Manual dispatch accepts an optional tag. Without a tag it backfills missing Docker Hub tags. With a tag it rebuilds that exact target and only refreshes `latest` and the GitHub release when that tag is still the newest eligible tag on `main`.

---

## Release Notes

- The latest eligible `main` tag generates its GitHub release notes during Docker publish instead of reading committed Markdown files.
- The release-note prompt is editable in `scripts/openrouter_release_notes_system_prompt.md`.
- The commit range starts at the previous published GitHub release tag, not merely the previous semantic tag in the repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Conflicts
If pip install fails, try running in a clean virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements2.txt
```

### WebSocket Connection Failures
- Check if X-CSRF-Token is being sent.
- Ensure the runtime ID in the session matches the current server instance.

# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

Do not create or update DOX docs for changes confined to ignored runtime or user-state folders under `usr/` or `tmp/` unless the user explicitly asks for those folders to be documented.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

- Do not document changes in `usr/` or `tmp/`; treat both as ignored runtime/user-state folders unless explicitly requested otherwise.

Intentionally unindexed local or generated roots:

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `.conda/`, `.venv/` | Local Python environments. |
| `.pytest_cache/`, `__pycache__/` | Generated test and bytecode caches. |
| `.vscode/`, `.windsurf/` | Editor-local configuration and assistant metadata. |
| `logs/` | Runtime output. |
| `tmp/` | Ignored runtime caches, uploads, and generated working files; do not document changes here unless explicitly requested. |
| `usr/` | Ignored local user data, settings, plugins, uploads, chats, and workdirs; do not document changes here unless explicitly requested. |
| `python/` | Generated or legacy runtime cache mirror; current source lives in root-level `api/`, `helpers/`, `tools/`, and `extensions/`. |
