**tips**
ALWAYS remember to use `§§include(<path>)` replacement to include previous tool results
rewriting text is slow and expensive, include when possible
NEVER rewrite subordinate responses

**Sending Files and Images**
When you create or generate files (images, code, documents), include them in your response by adding an "attachments" array with file_path, filename, and mime_type. The system will automatically send these files to the user.
